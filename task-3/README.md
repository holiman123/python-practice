### How to use:

1) Start program.
2) Write expression in input field in up area (or use buttons for it).<br>
***Always put spaces between elements!***
3) Press the button with " = " text.
4) See calculation result in field below input field.

#### Elements review:

1) Input area: area for input expression.
2) Output area: area for output expression result.
3) " **=** " : button to start caclulation.
4) " **clear** " : button to clear input area.
5) " **1** " - " **0** " : buttons to input numbers in input area.
6) " **(** ", " **)** " : buttons to input breckets to input area.
7) " **sin** " - " **actg** " : buttons to input trigonometry functions to input area.
8) " **bin** " : button to convert number in input area to binary format.
9) " **+** " - " **âˆš** " : buttons to input math operators to input field.
10) " **log** ", " **ln** " : buttons to add logarithm function to input area.<br>
***"log" function base is 10***
11) " **Button for game** " : button to fast divide by 160. Asked by my sister for game she plays (Genshit impact)

### Methods review:
Source code has some main methods, and some additional methods.

#### Main methods:
1)**"replaceWithcalc"**: Replace math structure ( x 'action' y) to it math equivalent.<br>
2)**"calc"**: Calculate math expression to number.<br>
3)**"translate"**: Translate standard expression entry to correct form for calc function.<br>
*"calc" and "Translate" are not merged to one method becouse of recursive nature of calc method.*

#### Additional methdos:
1) **"myReplace"**: Replacing elements in list/array.<br>
2) **"myLIndex"**: Find index of first element in list/array (like standard python *index* function).<br>
3) **"myRIndex"**: Find index of last element in list/array

#### Also there is two buttons event functions:
1) **"EqPressed"**: Equel button pressed event.<br>
2) **"Button1Pressed"**: Method for button events.
